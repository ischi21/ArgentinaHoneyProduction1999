# Argentina's Honey Production in 1999

### This map visualizes Argentina's honey industry through a choropleth map. It features a dark basemap to bring out the color scale for easy viewing. When hovering over each province, it becomes highlighted and displays the area's estimated tons of honey production, and when clicked it zooms into the province itself so information such as cities and roads can be viewed. I made the features such as the description and legend clean as to not distract from the map itself. The data was sourced from the USDA (1999).
